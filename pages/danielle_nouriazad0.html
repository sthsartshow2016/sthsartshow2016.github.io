                <h2>Artist's Statement</h2><p>The goal for this logo/wordmark is to represent a balance between masculinity and femininity, while also representing a particular style and aesthetic.
In light of Mr. Jackson’s work, I decided to combine rustic symbols with the delicacy of a vintage feel. Masculinity is represented by the power of the stag, while a feminine touch is tied in with a ribbon/banner. I also enjoy this aesthetic and used my abilities and techniques to create an all-around simple design, making sure to include details personal to Mr. Jackson. Trying my best to accomplish Mr. Jackson’s requests, I created a design that represents the products Mr. Jackson creates, while also allowing for issue-free technical use and appeal.</p>
