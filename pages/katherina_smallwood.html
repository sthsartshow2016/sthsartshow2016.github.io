                <h2>Artist's Statement</h2><p>The initial concept of my design is based on the premise of “One man’s trash is another 
man’s treasure”. To me it was almost like giving what one deemed useless to a man who
will find use to it. These days, most people don’t use this style of key for actual locks,
however many may appreciate it in its style, giving the keys a new use to someone who
may use it. As for the colors, I took a design and color to appear more rustic, having colors that give people a sense of age, thus the duller shades of red, blue and gold.</p>
