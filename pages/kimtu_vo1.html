                <h2>Artist's Statement</h2><p>When I had first heard of the design theme and requirements, the words that really caught my attention were: country chic. To me, anything that related to the word “country” immediately screamed cowboy (including the boots and hat), rustic, and vintage. I decided to use the cowboy boot, as that is one of the easiest symbol to associate with the word “country”. Because the client had wanted that carnival font, I took inspiration from many of the carnival font images on Google to make the N and W. Both letters are the main components of the words “Nothing Wasted” and can be used to symbolize it. Taking into mind the recycled jewelry meaning behind it, I also included a button for the ‘O’ because buttons are often used in recycled jewelry (and it adds a design element that looks cute and sophisticated!). In my design, I have also included the color design scheme that the client had wanted (turquoise, rust / red, and colors on Mater from Cars).</p>
