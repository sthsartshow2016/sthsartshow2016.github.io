                <h2>Artist's Statement</h2><p>My group decided to touch on the topic of prostitution and a prostitute’s backstory. We wanted to show that prostitutes are still people, despite their occupation. Although they have a negative connotation, they also have a justification for what they do. When people label or stereotype them without knowing the full story, it degrades them. Prostitutes are people who lie in the “gray” field; their story is not easy to explain or understand.
